<h1 align="center">Working width DB SqLite 🛢️</h1>

This project focuses on working with an SQLite database to manage a list of email addresses. The main class, `Kata5P1`, reads email addresses from a file, `email.txt`, and inserts them into an SQLite database named `mail.db`. The database has a single table named `direcc_email`, which stores email addresses.
